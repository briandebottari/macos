# macos-zsh-plugin
Zsh plugin for Mac OS

Provides the following aliases :

  * `cask` instead of `brew cask`
  * `cap` to capture the screen
  * `capi` to capture the selected screen area
  * `capw` to capture the selected window
  
Captures are saved in `$HOME` directory as `capture_<DATE>.png`.  
Adding `c` to the capture commands will instead copy the image in the clipboard.
